      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Pole zero analysis does not specifically calculate small signal gain and impedance.",
        "b": "Correct. Transfer function analysis is used for small signal gain and impedance calculation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. AC analysis is related but not as specific as transfer function analysis for this calculation.",
